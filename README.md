# OpenVAF-reloaded

OpenVAF is a Verilog-A compiler written by Pascal Kuthe. The compiler outputs a dynamic library whose functionality can be accessed via the OSDI API (version 0.3). The original compiler received no support since end of 2023. This fork of [the original repository](https://github.com/pascalkuthe/OpenVAF) was started by Árpád Bűrmen in early 2024. Since then several small bugs were fixed that prevented the use of OpenVAF for building SPICE3-equivalent device models. 

To add new functionality to OpenVAF the OSDI interface has been modified. Consequently the current version of OSDI API is 0.4. OSDI API 0.4 differs from version 0.3 in the module descriptor. It also exports `OSDI_DESCRIPTOR_SIZE` which can be used to traverse the array of descriptors without relying on the definition of the `OsdiDescriptor` structure (i.e. size of the structure in the OSDI header file used by the simulator). New members are added after the first part of the descriptor which still complies with the OSDI 0.3 specification. Simulators that support only OSDI 0.3 can still use models exposing the newer OSDI API by applying some minor changes. 

The last version of OpenVAF before the project was renamed to **OpenVAF-reloaded** and the binary was renamed to `openvaf-r` is tagged with `osdi_0.3`. The `master` branch includes several extensions of the compiler and exposes the OSDI 0.4 API in the generated models. The models generated by the compiler in the `branches/osdi_0.3` branch expose the old OSDI 0.3 API. This branch does not include compiler extensions as they depend on OSDI API 0.4. Both branches include all the bugfixes up to December 2024. As of December 2024 the `branches/osdi_0.3` branch is no longer maintained. 


# OSDI 0.4

In OSDI 0.4 new members are added to the module descriptor data structure after the members defined in the OSDI 0.3 specification. The descriptor (if cast to the declaration given in the OSDI 0.3 header file) remains compatible with OSDI 0.3 and should work just like before. Simulators using OSDI API 0.3 can be adapted to use version 0.4 by applying the following changes 
- allowing major.minor version >=0.4 beside 0.3, 
- reading the `OSDI_DESCRIPTOR_SIZE` symbol of type `uint32` specifying the descriptor size, 
- making sure the table of descriptors (pointed to by the `OSDI_DESCRIPTORS` symbol) is traversed in steps of size `OSDI_DESCRIPTOR_SIZE` instead of `sizeof(OsdiDescriptor)`, and
- casting each descriptor to the structure declared in the OSDI header file, version 0.3. 

This is the current state of OSDI 0.4 support

If you know of any other simulator supporting OSDI models generated by OpenVAF, let me know. 

Some internals of the OpenVAF compiler are documented in the [internals.md](internals.md) file. 

## What is new in OSDI 0.4 and OpenVAF in general? 

- OSDI descriptor size for traversing the OSDI descriptor table in simulators not supporting OSDI 0.4 
- Support for reading param given flags of parameters in the instance and model data structures. This is pretty much self-explanatory. Look at the [OSDI 0.4 header file](openvaf/osdi/header/osdi_0_4.h). This one takes care of issue #76 in the original repository. 
- Support for writing nonzero resistive and reactive Jacobian contributions to an array of doubles. 
- List of model inputs (node pairs). 
- Functions for loading Jacobians with offset (for harmonic balance analysis). 
- --dump-unopt-mir, --dump-mir, --dump-unopt-ir, and --dump-ir options for dumpring the (unoptimized) MIR and LLVM IR. 
- Support for $fatal, $finish, and $stop. 
- Loops no longer crash the compiler. 
- Natures, disciplines, and the corresponding attributes exposed in OSDI API. 
- Natures of unknowns and residuals exposed in OSDI descriptor. TODO: switch branches and implicit equations. 


# What about binaries? 

Yes, binaries for 64-bit Linux and Windows are available [here](https://fides.fe.uni-lj.si/openvaf/download). The naming scheme of the binaries is 

```
openvaf-reloaded-<version>-<platform>
```

The version name is generated with `git --describe`. The OpenVAF-reloaded that produces models with the OSDI API 0.3 is version `osdi_0.3`. All newer versions (`osdi_0.4`) produce models with OSDI API 0.4. 

If the binary is named `openvaf` it comes from the `branches/osdi_0.3` branch and produces models with the OSDI 0.3 API. If the binary is named `openvaf-r` it comes from the `master` branch and produces models with the OSDI 0.4 API. 


# Building OpenVAF-reloaded

## Setting up the dependencies under Debian Bookworm

Everything was tested under Debian 13. First, install Rust as ordinary user (files will go to `~/.cargo` and `~/.rustup`). 
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
During installation select "Customize installation" and set profile to "complete". 

Build LLVM and Clang. Download [LLVM 18.1.8 sources](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-18.1.8). Unpack them (this creates directory `llvm-project-llvmorg-18.1.8`) and create a build directory and decide where you want to install LLVM. Type 
```
cmake -S <path to souces>/llvm -B <path to build dir> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<LLVM install directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;ARM;AArch64" -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="llvm;clang;lld"
```

Enter the build directory and type
```
make -j <number of processors to use>
make install
```

Set up the environment by adding the following to `.bashrc`
```
export LLVM_SYS_181_PREFIX=<LLVM install directory>
export PATH=<LLVM install directory>/bin:$PATH
```

Make sure the Bash login script is read again (either log out and in again, or type `source ~/.bashrc`) Now you are good to go. 

## Setting up the dependencies under Windows

Download [rustup](https://win.rustup.rs), run it to install Rust. 
During installation select "Customize installation" and set profile to "complete". 

Install Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. Make sure you install CMake Tools that come with VS2022 (also installs Ninja). 

Build LLVM and Clang. Download [LLVM 18.1.8 sources](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-18.1.8) sources (get the .zip file). Unpack the sources (this creates directory `llvm-project-llvmorg-18.1.8`). Create a build directory and decide where you want to install LLVM. 

Start Visual Studio x64 native command prompt. Run CMake, use Ninja as build system. Do not use default (nmake) because for me it always built the Debug version, even when I specified Release. 
```
cmake -G Ninja -S <path to souces>/llvm -B <path to build dir> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<LLVM install directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;ARM;AArch64" -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="llvm;clang;lld"
```
Enter build directory and run Ninja (build and install)
```
ninja 
ninja install 
```

Add the LLVM binary directory (`<LLVM install directory>\bin`) to the PATH. Set the `LLVM_SYS_181_PREFIX` environmental variable to `<LLVM install directory>`.

Restart command prompt. Now you are good to go.

## Setting up the dependencies under macOS

Install Homebrew if not already installed, then install LLVM 18:
```bash
brew install llvm@18
```

Set up the environment by adding the following to `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` if using bash):
```bash
export LLVM_SYS_181_PREFIX=$(brew --prefix llvm@18)
export PATH="$(brew --prefix llvm@18)/bin:$PATH"
```

Make sure the shell configuration is read again (either restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc`).

Install Rust if not already installed:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

During installation select "Customize installation" and set profile to "complete".

Now you are good to go.


## Building

### Quick Build (macOS only)

On macOS, you can use the convenience script which automatically sets up the environment:
```bash
./build-macos.sh
```

This will configure LLVM 18 paths and build the release version.

### Manual Build

To build the release version (`target/release/openvaf-r`), type
```
cargo build --release --bin openvaf-r
```

To build the debug version (`target/debug/openvaf-r`), type
```
cargo build --bin openvaf-r
```

# Debugging OpenVAF-reloaded in Visual Studio Code 

You will need two extensions: CodeLLDB (under Linux) / Microsoft C++ (under Windows) and rust-analyzer. In the `.vscode` directory there are two files: `launch-openvaf-r.json` (for working with the master branch) and `launch-openvaf.json` (for working with the branches/osdi_0.3 branch). Copy the one that matches your branch to `launch.json`. There are two debug setups available in that file (Linux and Windows). Set your breakpoints and run the program. If there are any changes since the last build they will be applied upon which the program will be started and then stop at the first breakpoint. 

The debug configuration disables rayon running the .osdi file build process in parallel so that debugging the last step of compilation is somewhat easier. 


# Running tests with cargo

Pascal has set up a test suite for OpenVAF.

## Quick Test (macOS only)

On macOS, you can use the convenience script which automatically sets up the environment:
```bash
./test-macos.sh
```

This will configure LLVM 18 paths and run all tests including integration tests.

## Manual Testing

To run the tests on the debug version of the binary type

    cargo test

To run the tests on the release version type

    cargo test --release

By default only fast tests are run. To run all tests set the `RUN_SLOW_TEST` variable to 1, e.g.

    RUN_SLOW_TESTS=1 cargo test

## Integration Tests

Integration tests compile real-world Verilog-A models (BSIM, HiSIM, PSP, MEXTRAM, etc.) and verify the generated OSDI libraries. These tests are disabled by default but can be enabled with:

    RUN_DEV_TESTS=1 cargo test --release --test integration

On macOS with LLVM 18, all integration tests should pass.

## Updating Expected Test Results

Your changes may fail some tests although they are correct. Consider the case you changed the MIR generator. The expected test results assume MIR is generated the way Pascal did it. If you are sure your changes are correct you can update the expected values (stored in `openvaf/test_data` as files ending with .snap). To do this set the `UPDATE_EXPECT` variable 1, e.g.

    UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test

Unfortunately not all expected results are in .snap files. Some are hard-coded in the test sources, e.g. see `openvaf/mir_autodiff/src/builder/tests.rs`. You will have to update these expected values manually.

# Contributing and Support

OpenVAF development takes place on [Github](https://github.com/arpadbuermen/OpenVAF).
If you run into problems, please open an [issue](https://github.com/arpadbuermen/OpenVAF/issues).
Everyone is invited to contribute to the project by forking it and opening a [pull request](https://github.com/arpadbuermen/OpenVAF/pulls).
Development related details can be found in the README of the [github repository](https://github.com/arpadbuermen/OpenVAF).
You are invited to ask questions in [discussions](https://github.com/arpadbuermen/OpenVAF/discussions), create pull requests and report bugs.

OSDI support for `ngspice` is maintained in the ngspice repo [here](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/).
The OSDI integration can be found in `src/osdi`.
Problems that occur during simulation instead of during compilation should be reported to the [ngspice bugtracker](https://sourceforge.net/p/ngspice/bugs/).
If the problem turns out to be caused by OpenVAF it will be moved to the OpenVAF bug tracker.
